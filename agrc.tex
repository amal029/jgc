\label{sec:agrc-analysis}

In order to statically determine the worst case memory consumption of a
program targeting TP-JOP, one needs to analyze codes generated from both
CNs and JDNs. The compiler is able to trivially determine the maximum
memory footprint required for executing CN codes from any given SystemJ
programs [] since there is no dynamic memory allocation required for
executing this code. On the other hand, the data-flow analysis for JDNs
is more intricate since it needs to analyze the original AGRC in order
to retrieve the dependency edges, which are lost after splitting CNs and
JDNs from the AGRC. We devote this section to illustrate this analysis
technique.
